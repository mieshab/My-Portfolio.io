									<h2><a href="#">Introductory<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>My overall review of this semester in ENG101 has been a challenge. I say that because I expected a way higher grade than I got on most of the papers I turned in. I feel like now, since the semester is coming to an end, I have seen some things that could have been done better. I could have used the 10 writing concepts more and been more descriptive in my essays instead of cutting straight to the point. Writing has always been my weakness, itâ€™s just something about me trying to visualize a picture in my head, then breaking it down piece by piece to how I see it, is difficult. I feel like if I had taken this class in person, I would have grasped the concepts of things better.</p>

										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="C:\Users\miesh\Downloads\Essay 1 ENG101 (1).docx" 
									<p>My approach for this essay was to first figure out who I want my story to be based on. I took the concepts and reflections from Mark Twain's essay about the river to make my essay come to life and as vivid as Mark were about the river. Also, I used some actions verbs we pratice on before doing the essay and I couldn't forget about the 5 senses.  </p>
									My tutoring experience was great it help me through most of my assignments. Most of the tutors gave great feedback leading me to better understand what the assignment rubric was asking for. I feel like if I didn't have the tutors by my side throught this semester I don't think I would have made it through this far. Writing is challenging I think writing qualifies for you to have a vivid eye to things. Which I'm trying to seek to now but I say this semester has taught me a lot and that I should pay more attention to small details beacause everything counts in writing.

									<a href="C:\Users\miesh\Downloads\Second Draft Essay #2 ENG101.docx" 
									<p>My approach for this essay was to first come up with an ancedote and create an story around that. Also I made sure it had a descriptive hook to the piece, made sure I used quotes right, summarize the text that went along with my essay.</p>

									<p>My approach for this essay was similar to the second one. Instead I wrote about something passionate in the words of Baca language.</p>
